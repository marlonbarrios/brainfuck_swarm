# BrainFuck Swarm Evolution

An interactive evolutionary ecosystem where Brainfuck code programs evolve, reproduce, form symbiotic relationships, and create emergent behaviors through self-organization and active inference.

## Overview

BrainFuck Swarm is a living simulation where simple code fragments evolve into complex organisms. Each organism is a Brainfuck program that executes its code to determine its behavior, appearance, and interactions. The system implements principles from evolutionary biology, autopoiesis, the Free Energy Principle, and active inference to create a self-organizing, evolving ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

### Organisms
- **Genotype**: The Brainfuck code (`tape`) that defines an organism's program
- **Phenotype**: Visual appearance and behavior derived from code execution
- **Complexity**: Measured by valid Brainfuck instructions (max 64)
- **Lifecycle**: Birth → Growth → Reproduction → Death (starvation, lifespan, or low fitness)

### Food
- Starts as simple code fragments with minimal complexity
- Executes code to self-organize and evolve
- When complexity reaches threshold (10), food evolves into an organism
- Implements Free Energy Principle from the beginning

### Code Execution
- Each organism executes its Brainfuck code every frame
- Code execution determines:
  - Movement patterns
  - Visual appearance (size, color, shape)
  - Social behaviors
  - Sound generation
  - Memory patterns

## Evolutionary Mechanisms

### 1. Developmental Progression
```
Food (simple code) → Self-organization → Complexity threshold → Organism
```
- Food items start with 2-5 random Brainfuck instructions
- They execute code, increasing complexity through self-organization
- When complexity ≥ 10, food transforms into a full organism with genotype and phenotype

### 2. Self-Replication
- Organisms replicate their own code when conditions are met:
  - Age threshold reached
  - Sufficient complexity
  - Adequate food consumed
  - Low hunger level
- Replication includes:
  - Code copying with 95% fidelity
  - Small mutations (5% chance)
  - Trait inheritance
  - Visual pulse effect

### 3. Code Evolution Through Interactions
- When organisms interact (collide), their codes combine
- Combined code execution creates new behaviors
- Successful interactions strengthen relationships
- Code evolves based on:
  - Fitness landscape values
  - Relationship affinity
  - Environmental conditions

### 4. Natural Selection
- **Starvation**: Organisms die if hunger reaches 100
- **Lifespan**: Organisms expire after 3000-8000 frames
- **Fitness**: Low fitness organisms are removed
- **Predation**: More complex organisms can consume less complex ones (phagocytosis)

### 5. Phagocytosis
- Visual engulfment process where one organism slowly wraps around and consumes another
- Requires complexity difference > 4
- Creates membrane wrapping animation
- Absorbs code from consumed organism

## Symbiosis and Superorganisms

### Symbiont Relationships
- Two organisms form symbiotic bonds when:
  - Genotype compatibility > 0.7
  - Proximity maintained for 60 frames
  - Compatible movement patterns
- Benefits:
  - Shared resources
  - Coordinated movement
  - Enhanced food sensing
  - Visual membrane connection

### Superorganisms
- Clusters of 3+ symbionts with compatible genotypes
- Form hierarchical structures:
  - Individual organisms
  - Symbiont pairs (with membranes)
  - Superorganisms (clusters of symbionts)
- Superorganisms have:
  - Organic, amoeba-like membranes (Markov blankets)
  - Shared collective memory
  - Coordinated behaviors
  - Pseudopod extensions

### Membranes (Markov Blankets)
- Visual boundaries separating internal states from external environment
- Implement Free Energy Principle's boundary conditions
- Three types:
  1. **Symbiont membranes**: Wrap around pairs, fluid and organic
  2. **Superorganism membranes**: Enclose clusters, amoeba-like with pseudopods
  3. **Cluster boundaries**: Organic boundaries around organism groups
- All membranes feature:
  - Pseudopod extensions (3-10 per membrane)
  - Fluid, unpredictable movement
  - Multiple noise layers for organic deformation
  - Wave motion for fluid feel

## Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

The system implements the Free Energy Principle, where organisms maintain generative models and act to minimize prediction error.

### Generative Model
Organisms predict:
- Food locations
- Other organism positions
- Fitness landscape values
- Expected hunger levels
- Sound states (frequency, volume)

### Prediction Errors
Computed differences between predicted and actual states:
- Food location error
- Organism position error
- Hunger error
- Fitness error
- Sound frequency/volume errors

### Free Energy
Measure of prediction error to be minimized:
```
Free Energy = Prediction Error + Complexity Penalty + Surprise
```

### Active Inference
Organisms plan actions to minimize free energy:
- **Exploitation**: Move toward predicted food
- **Exploration**: Move toward areas with high uncertainty
- **Avoidance**: Move away from predicted threats

### Sound as Active Inference
- Sound parameters evolve to minimize free energy
- Frequency and volume reflect organism state
- Acoustic coupling: nearby organisms influence each other
- Only top 2 most complex organisms generate sound

## Sound System

### Sound Generation
- Only the 2 most complex organisms produce sound
- Frequency based on:
  - Complexity
  - Genotype signature
  - Free energy
- Volume based on:
  - Complexity
  - Free energy
- Frequency range: 150-600 Hz
- Volume range: 0.0008-0.003

### Sound Management
- Strict limits to prevent audio overload
- Maximum 2 active oscillators
- Automatic cleanup when organisms lose top-2 status
- Sound stops when:
  - Organism dies
  - Organism falls out of top 2
  - User disables sound ('S' key)

## Visual Features
